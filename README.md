1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   **pip install -r requirements.txt**

3. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
   **streamlit run app.py**
   

5. The app will open in your web browser. You can enter the relevant data in the input fields and click the "Predict" button to get sales predictions.
